The following reflection(s) give some insights on how to better interact with users. Use them to improve your strategy of recommending.\\nReflections:\\n- The user became dissatisfied with the recommendations because they were not able to receive their preferred game, \"Firewatch\", and instead received alternative recommendations. The user may have been looking for a specific game or had a strong preference for \"Firewatch\". To mitigate this failure, the agent should prioritize recommending the user\\'s preferred games and ensure that alternative recommendations closely align with the user\\'s preferences.\\n- The user has become dissatisfied with the recommendations because they have already played or are familiar with the recommended games. Additionally, the user may be looking for more variety in terms of genres and gameplay mechanics. In the future, I should consider the user\\'s previous gaming history to avoid recommending games they have already played or are not interested in. I should also provide a diverse range of options by recommending games from different genres and with different gameplay mechanics. This will help to ensure that the user remains engaged and satisfied with the recommendations.\\n\\nQuestion: The user\\'s viewing history is [\\'LIMBO\\', \\'Batman™: Arkham Origins\\', \\'FEIST\\', \"Assassin\\'s Creed® Unity\"], please recommend item for this user\\nThought 1:'}]\n",
